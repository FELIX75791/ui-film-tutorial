    <h2>Why Cinematography Techniques Matter</h2>

    <div class="why-grid">
      <div class="why-card">
        <h3>Visual Storytelling</h3>
        <p>Cinematography techniques are the visual language of film. They communicate subtext, emotions, and themes without a single word of dialogue. A well-executed Dutch angle can convey psychological distress more effectively than pages of exposition.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-card">
        <h3>Emotional Impact</h3>
        <p>Camera movements, lighting choices, and framing directly influence how audiences feel. A low-angle shot creates feelings of power and dominance, while a tracking shot creates immersion, pulling viewers deeply into the narrative experience.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-card">
        <h3>Character Development</h3>
        <p>How characters are framed and lit reveals their inner state and development. A character shot through obstructions suggests entrapment, while gradually shifting from unstable handheld shots to steady movements can mirror a character’s psychological journey.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-card">
        <h3>Audience Manipulation</h3>
        <p>Directors use cinematography to direct attention, create suspense, and evoke specific reactions. A rack focus can shift attention precisely where needed, while a dolly zoom can create immediate visceral disorientation during moments of revelation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-card">
        <h3>Artistic Expression</h3>
        <p>Every filmmaker develops a visual signature through their cinematography choices. From Wes Anderson’s symmetrical framing to Christopher Nolan’s IMAX sequences, these techniques become part of a director’s unique voice and storytelling approach.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-card">
        <h3>Cultural Impact</h3>
        <p>Innovative cinematography techniques become cultural touchstones. The bullet-time effect from “The Matrix,” the Steadicam sequence in “Goodfellas,” or the rotating hallway in “Inception” transcend their films to influence not just cinema but advertising, music videos, and visual culture.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="why-conclusion">
      <p>Understanding these techniques empowers you as both a filmmaker and viewer. You’ll create more intentional, impactful visual stories and develop a deeper appreciation for the craft behind your favorite films.</p>
